/**
a) Implement a function:int printMonthCalendar(int numOfDays, int startingDay)

This function is given two parameters:
**numOfDays - the number of days in the month
**startingDay - a number 1-7 that represents the day in the week of the first day in that month (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 3 for Wednesday, etc.)

Function should:
Print a formatted monthly calendar of that month
Return a number 1-7 that represents the day in the week of the last day in that month.

b) Write a function that takes in a year as input and return true if the year is a leap year, return false otherwise.

c) Implement a function: void printYearCalendar(int year, int startingDay)

Function is given two parameters:
year - an integer that represents a year
startingDay - a number 1-7 that represents the day in the week of 1/1 in that year (1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 3 for Wednesday, etc.)

d) Write a program that interacts with the user and your function in (c)
