/*
Write 2 versions of a program that reads a sequence of positive integers from the user, calculates their geometric mean and prints the geometric mean.

Notes:
* Geometric mean of 2, 9, 12, is = to 6(\sqrt[3]{2 * 9 * 12} = 6)
* In order to calculate the n-th root of a num, you should call pow function in <cmath>

Version A:
*Execution will look like...
Please enter the length of the sequence: 3
Please enter your sequence:
1
2
3
The geometric mean is: 1.8171

Version B:
* Keep reading nums until -1 is entered. Execution will look like...
Please enter a non-empty sequence of positive integers, each one in a separate line. End your sequence by typing -1:
1
2
3
-1
The geomtric mean is 1.8171
