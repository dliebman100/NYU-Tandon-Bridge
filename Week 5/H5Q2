/*
Implement a number guessing game. The program should randomly choose an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and have the user try to guess that number.

**user can only guess 5 times
** Before each guess: annouce how many guesses the user has left & update guessing number
**If the user guesses correctly the program should announce that and say how many guesses they used
**If the guesses wrong and you still have guesses, the program should tell the user if the number is bigger or smaller than number guessed
**If the user didn't guess the number in 5 tries the program should reveal the number
