/*
Write a program that computes the cost of a long-distance call. The cost of a call is determined by the following schedule:
* Any call started between 0800 and 1800, Mon-Fri, is billed at a rate of $0.40 per minute.
* Any call starting before 0800 or after 1600, Mon-Fri, is charged at a rate of $0.25 per minute.
* Any call started on a Sat or Sun is charged at a rate of $0.15 per minute.

Input will consist of:
* the day of the week.
* the time the call started.
* the length of the call in minutes.

**Output will be the cost of the call.

Notes:
* Time input is in 24hr notation
* Day of the week will be read as two char string: Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa, Su.
* Number of minutes will be input as positive integer.
