/*
Write a program that does the following:
//Asks user to input three Real numbers (a,b,c) which represent the parameters of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0
//Classify to one of the following
  //'Infinite number of solutions' (ex: 0x^2 + 0x + 0 = 0 has an infinite number of solutions.)
  //'No solution' (ex: 0x^2 + 0x + 4 = 0 has no solution.)
  //'No real solution' (ex: x^2 + 4 = 0 has no real solutions.)
  //'One real solution'
  //'Two real solutions'
Notes:
//if a != 0 and there are real solutions to the equation, you can get these solutions using the quadratic formula.
//in order to calculate the sqrt of a number (of type double), you should call the sqrt function, located in cmath library.

Your program should interact with the user exactly as it shows:
Please enter value of a: 1
Please enter value of b: 4
Please enter value of c: 4
This equation has a single real solution x = -2.0
