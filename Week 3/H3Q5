/*
Body mass index(BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight & height using the formula: weight/height^2. Where weight is in kg and height is in meters.

Write a program that prompts for weight (in pounds) and height (in inches) of a person, and prints the weight status of that person.

Your program should	interact with	the	user exactly as	it shows	in the following example:
//Please enter weight (in	pounds): 135
//Please enter height (in	inches): 71
//The	weight status is:	Normal

Note:	1	pound	is 0.453592	kilograms	and	1	inch is	0.0254	meters.
